                <p> 
                    When Iâ€™m not parked at my computer coding, you can find me singing along at rock concerts, 
                    stabbing my fingers needle felting, or curled up in my rocking chair enjoying a good book. 
                    I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at The College
                    of Wooster. I'm very comfortable programming in Python and C++. I have experience in UI design 
                    using Kivy. I've dabbled in creating databases using SQLite and QT Creator. Beyond coding, 
                    I thrive on connecting with people, understanding their unique strengths, and 
                    fostering collaboration for greater success. Let's connect and discover how our 
                    strengths can synergize in your workplace. I'm eager to embark on this journey together!

                <h2>Literary Favorites</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/769016"> How To Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk</a></li>
                    <p>A surprisingly insightful book on communication! My mom recommended it to me and I was skeptical at first but it does a great job at describing in simple terms how to make people feel seen and heard</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/51952355">Wolfpack</a></li>
                    <p>An inspiring book on empowerment. You'll read it in an hour but it will provide motivation for months. The messages on cultivating and supporting your team are short and sweet.</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121988866-my-stupid-intentions"> My Stupid Intentions </a> </li>
                    <p>This book was pretty strange! It follows a beech marten (a type of weasel) on his search for purpose. The author grapples with both the positives and negatives of surviving versus thriving.</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo">The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</a></li>
                    <p>Super fun read! Evelyn is a wonderful character and who doesn't enjoy the drama of Hollywood. They also tie in a lot of historical events and give some really interesting perspective into that time.</p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone">Maybe You Should Talk To Someone</a></li>
                    <p>I didn't expect to be laughing so much at a book about therapy but here we are.</p>
